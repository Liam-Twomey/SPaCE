Usage of the SPaCE package
==========================

SPaCE consists of three classes:

* ``spin``, which generates a spin population,
* ``pulse``, which defines pulses
* ``trajectory``, which calculates the trajectory of the spins over time
  (i.e. simulates the experiment) 
* ``inversion``, which uses an FFT to estimate the behavior of spins under a pulse.
  Useful for testing pulses.
